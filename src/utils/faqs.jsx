    question:
      'How do you think collaboration with companies help improve the technical culture of our campus?',
    answer:
      'A collaboration will be beneficial to all the parties involved. The company will get bright technical assistance at a very low cost, the students will get the experience and training from working on real world projects, and everyone will get more publicity. The ideas from industry are more practical and students and companies can collaborate on solutions and products - the companies willing to sponsor some devices given specific requirements can collaborate with the students who can work on those particular requirements.',

    question:
      'How does the Sandbox set us apart from other colleges and universities in India?',
    answer:
      'Though Sandbox is still in its early stages, we are able to provide the students will excellent facilities that they have used to their advantage. Students in our campus can now get free access to equipment that others only dream of. The experience gained by the students working in Sandbox has also helped them a lot as is evident by 3 students going for their thesis in Portugal, 1 in USA, 1 in Singapore, 1 for a summer internship in Amazon and another in Navstik Labs and many more.\n\nSimilar to the fact that a healthy mind lives in a healtyh body, having a facility like Sandbox helps one to do better research and development. We still have a long way to go and we only hope to be comparable if not better to other fablabs in developed countries.',
